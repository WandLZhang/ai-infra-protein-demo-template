## 1. HPC Cloud Burst  *(slide: `home`)*

As you can imagine, Google designs its own silicon, network, and datacenters — which makes bursting HPC to Google worth a closer look as Gartner did. Here is their latest report. (Click open https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2NMT0142&ct=260630&st=sb)

One your screen is a simulated on-prem Slurm cluster that will burst out into a connected cluster in the cloud when I press Enter. Here is the actual VM (click VM). This will launch six protein-folding jobs across TPU and GPU, to whichever region has capacity.

---

## 2. Multi-Region Burst  *(slide: `dispatching` / `running`)*

Now researchers keep the identity they already use using [Managed AD](https://cloud.google.com/managed-microsoft-ad/docs/overview) to bridge their on-prem login into the cloud. And capacity takes care of itself: if a zone can't grab a node, Slurm waits and retries in the next region — you'll see the jobs move across west, central and east regions on their own. (Click VM) Here you see these VMs are in a different environment than one prem but it's still the technically the same slurm cluster.

## 3. Research Applications Catalog  *(slide: `catalog`)*

(Open info box)

Every research institution runs hundreds of software titles. We sort them into three shapes — **independent GPU jobs, data-anchored burst, and tightly-coupled simulation** — ordered quickest cloud win to deepest HPC.

---

## 4. Independent GPU Jobs  *(slide: `pd1`)*

This current demo shows the easy independent GPU genre of jobs. AlphaFold, ESMFold, and Boltz-2 each run on a single GPU and TPU and fan out in parallel. Only on Google can our [Hyperdisk ML](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/persistent-volumes/hyperdisk-ml) storage serve the weights up to 2,500 nodes, GPUs start in 2 minutes not 15, and a single [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/whats-new-in-gke-at-next26) control plane run a million chips.

---

## 5. Independent GPU Jobs: Fractional & Serverless  *(slide: `img`)*

Inference is huge now, and not every researcher needs a full H100. Only on Google can you split up the [RTX PRO 6000 GPUs](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/accelerator-optimized-machines#g4-series) so one researcher gets 4 chips while another gets 2 — and a job can even run serverless, with a GPU, on [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/services/gpu). AWS Lambda and App Runner still have no GPU at all.

## 6. Data-Anchored Burst: Storage  *(slide: `catalog2`)*

Now the next workload — medium difficulty. Some datasets are huge but static, like cryo-EM. Only Google has [multi-region buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/cloud-storage-fuse/overview), so burst nodes share one namespace across regions — read anywhere, write results back, no copies to manage.

---

## 7. Data-Anchored Burst: vs AWS & Azure  *(slide: `catalog4`)*

(open box)

Neither AWS nor Azure can match this: S3 and Azure Blob have no multi-region buckets — and no [Rapid Cache](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/rapid/rapid-cache), no [Rapid Bucket](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/rapid/rapid-bucket), the extremely fast ways we save checkpoints and serve weights. Our storage is uniquely suited in the market for AI infrastructure workloads.

---

## 8. Tightly-Coupled Simulation  *(slide: `md1`)*

The deepest shape is tightly-coupled MPI — molecular dynamics, CFD, finite-element. Our [Managed Lustre](https://docs.cloud.google.com/managed-lustre/docs/overview) is far and away the fastest hot scratch — 5 to 20× faster than our competitors. And Google can manage these jobs by [placing ranks on the same rack](https://docs.cloud.google.com/cluster-director/docs/orchestration), [predicting when a node will fail 5 hours early](https://docs.cloud.google.com/ai-hypercomputer/docs/workloads/enable-node-health-prediction), and using [optical circuit switching](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/introducing-virgo-megascale-data-center-fabric) to reroute around a dead chip mid-run — no restart.

---

## 9. TPUs  *(slide: `tpu1`)*

About 90% of [gen-AI unicorns run on Google](https://cloud.google.com/ai-infrastructure) — and a major reason is the differentiator no one else has: TPUs. [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/expanding-our-use-of-google-cloud-tpus-and-services) runs Claude on up to a million chips, OpenAI serves ChatGPT inference on TPU, and [Midjourney](https://cloud.google.com/customers/midjourney)'s monthly bill dropped from $2M to $700K. The economics are structural: TPUs run 30 to 40% cheaper than the top NVIDIA chips ([SemiAnalysis](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/tpuv7-google-takes-a-swing-at-the)), at higher utilization, on 42% less power per rack.

---

## 10. TorchTPU: ESMFold in 4 Lines  *(slide: `tpu3`)*

And researchers don't have to change their stack — [TorchTPU](https://developers.googleblog.com/torchtpu-running-pytorch-natively-on-tpus-at-google-scale/) runs PyTorch natively on TPU. The diff between our GPU and TPU backends for ESMFold is just **four lines of code**.

---

## 11. AI Models Only Google Has  *(slide: `models1`)*

Alphabet is **#3 in the world** for research output, ahead of every other tech company: **AlphaFold, the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, used by 3 million researchers** — plus AlphaGenome, AlphaEvolve, Co-Scientist and many more. /Google invented the substrate the whole industry runs on — **the Transformer, TensorFlow, Kubernetes, and JAX** — so you get **both halves of the stack, the infrastructure and the science, from one place**, bought the way public research is funded: fixed-price [**PSSA**](https://cloud.google.com/edu/researchers) with incentives through **GPAR**.
